# EnableScaleformLog

A simple patch for Grand Theft Auto V that redirects scaleform logging to the `scaleform.log` file, instead of ignoring it.

## Requirements

* ASI loader (for example, dinput8.dll included with [ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)).

## Installation

* Download pre-built binaries from [Releases](https://github.com/alexguirre/gtav-EnableScaleformLog/releases).
* Place `EnableScaleformLog.asi` in the root directory of your Grand Theft Auto V installation.
